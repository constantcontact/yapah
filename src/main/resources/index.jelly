   <p>Yet Another Pullrequest Plugin.  This plugin consists of a trigger to poll for any new poll requests baesd on a cron that is supplied in the build and a post action build item that comments on the pull request with a pass / fail message.  Pull requests can still be merged but are done so with a warning. </p>
